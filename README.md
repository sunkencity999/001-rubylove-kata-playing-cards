# TDD Playing Cards in Ruby

The goal of this Kata is to incrementally build up a functional deck of playing cards using Minitest and Ruby using a test driven approach and coming to our final solution via approximation.

## Getting Started

This Kata can be performed in any version of Ruby, however Minitest is only in as of 1.9 and later, so I suggest you start there. I can see no reason today to use 1.8.

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your system.
2. Open ```playing_cards.rb``` in your favorite editor, which by now should be VIM.
3. Uncomment the first test.
4. Write the passing implementation above the test code.
5. Run the file using ```ruby -rminitest/pride playing_cards.rb```
6. Your first test should pass.
7. Uncomment the next test and repeat the process
