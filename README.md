# TDD Playing Cards in Ruby

This kata is an exercise in beginning functional programming in Ruby. It will teach you how to build up simple, immutable objects in a test-driven fashion.

The goal is to get the tests to pass in an incremental approach, writing as little code as possible to get new test to pass. Do not code what you haven't been asked to code, and do not skip ahead to include more in the current iteration than is required.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your system.
2. Open ```playing_cards.rb``` in your favorite editor, which by now should be VIM.
3. Uncomment the first test.
4. Write the passing implementation above the test code.
5. Run the file using ```ruby -rminitest/pride playing_cards.rb```
6. Your first test should pass.
7. Uncomment the next test and repeat the process
